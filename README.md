Yt::Support - common code needed by the other Yt gems.
======================================================

Yt::Support provides common functionality to Yt and Yt::Auth such as:

* [Yt.configure](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yt-support/Yt/Config#configure-instance_method)
* [Yt::Configuration](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yt-support/Yt/Configuration)

It is considered suitable for internal use only at this time.



How to contribute
=================

Contribute to the code by forking the project, adding the missing code,
writing the appropriate tests and submitting a pull request.

In order for a PR to be approved, all the tests need to pass and all the public
methods need to be documented and listed in the guides. Remember:

- to run all tests locally: `bundle exec rspec`
- to generate the docs locally: `bundle exec yard`
- to list undocumented methods: `bundle exec yard stats --list-undoc`
